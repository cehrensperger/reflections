This is a visualization that attempts to answer the question of what the most popular songs on Spotify tend to do. This includes factors like their loudness, danceability, tempo, and more. I think these are interesting qualities to track in a song and it would make sense that they would determine how popular a song might get. Some things I like about this visualization are how it mimicks the design language of Spotify itself, how the main visualization is designed to look like an audio waveform, and how it combines multiple simple scatter plot visualizations underneath the main visualization. It is fun to think about what I like in a song in terms of the qualities included in the data visualization and how those may or may not correlate to popularity. I think it also makes sense to design the main visualization to look like a waveform since this is something people who are going to be viewing this visualization are likely to know how to interpret rather quickly. I also liked the ability to click on any one of the bars in the main visualization or any one of the circles in the scatter plots to preview the song itself. One aspect I didn't like about the visualization was the fact that the way this data was determined and collected was not made very clear. For example, how did the creator of this visualization judge how danceable a song is? There was also a bug with dragging to select multiple bars within the main visualization. This may not have been an intended piece of functionality and I could see this being caused by using a high-level, low-code platform that didn't give quite enough granularity of control.
