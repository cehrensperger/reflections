This data visualization came from the dataisbeautiful subreddit. I know this is to be used sparingly, so this is my first time using it. The overall idea of the visualization is that the white line represents the actual interest rate over time and the other colored lines represent forecasts/predictions of how interest rate will be in the future at those points in time. Some things I like are the use of color to clearly group the forecasts and separate them from reality, the ability to quickly grasp the idea that we tend to be biased towards being pesimistic about the future, and the use of color to represent when the forecasts/predictions were upward or downward. The color grouping, as talked about in class, lets me quickly categorize visually and mentally the main groupings (three groups of downward predictions and the around 6 groups of upward predictions). What I don't like as much is the use of hue and/or saturation to indicate the severity of how far up or down the predictions are. Firstly, it might not be immediately aparent that red would be associated with the downward predictions and blue would be associated with upward predictions. To me, lower interest rates would be a good thing and so I would not expect them to be associated with the color red, which I typically associate with negative things like warnings or danger. There is also a curious use of a purplish color which, at least to me, serves no puropse as I do not know where this fits in with the rest of the color spectrum being used. I also think the dotted line is a good distinguisher, but could be made more visible amongst all of the other lines. Overall, I like the immediate messages I was able to pick up from this visualization due to the use of color, but I think color was also overused/overloaded with too many information communicating responsibilites. I think using color to distinguish between reality, forecasted upward, and forecasted downward lines was effective, but the use of hue/saturation was not as effective.
