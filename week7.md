This visualization shows the result of a study where researchers had 10000 people list ten things that recently made them happy. The first column of circles represents the subject of the statements, the second represents the verb, and the third represents the object. I think this visualization does a very good job of communicating message rather than just displaying the data for the sake of it. For example, I felt that the lines that were used as examples of common phrases involving the associated words gave the visualization more impact and personalization. I also found it interesting that so many of the responses started with the individual and this visualization makes this very clear and digestible. I also found it interesting that responses that started with other subjects than the individual often ended with "me", which is based around the individual. The design of the visualization with the color representing which subject that circle is most associated with made this easy to determine. I also think it was a good design choice to only label circles of a certain size, as labeling any more of them would most likely have become too cluttered. One feature I might have liked, however, would be the ability hover over the smaller circles to see which word it represents. Finally, I liked the decision to use both color and vertical position to represent the association with a subject of the individual vs another subject. I think either could have been used on its own but together, they make it extra clear and readable.
