This is a simple data visualization that shows many yearly temperatures as compared to a long-term average temperature. I think this is a good example of using color effectively, although I do have a few issues with the visualization. What I like about it is that, as long as you know the context is that it relates to climate change I think the meaning behind the data is immediately clear. As time went on, yearly temperatures have risen to an extreme point such that the color that represents the current year at the time this was posted is a dark red. I think this accomplishes its goal of creating a sense of urgency and drive for action as I think a simple color scale of blue to red is an intuitive way to depict cold and hot. The one issue I have with the color choices is that the color white is used as an intermediary between blue and red. This confused me at first because I could see white being used to communicate something very hot or very cold rather than an inbetween. My mind immediately goes to white snow in very cold climates or metals that turn nearly white when heated to extremely hot temperatures. I think this can confuse the viewer and distracts from the overall message. I also would have appreciated some more nuance within the visualization itself as the context of each yearly temperature being compared to a long-term average is not shown within the visualization. Finally, I think including a horizontal time scale or a legend would have made the initial analysis of this graphic easier, more informational, and more impactful.
